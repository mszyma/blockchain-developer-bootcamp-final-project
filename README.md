## F1 NFT cards based on the final F1 Championship standing
The project will gather chainlink F1 oracle data and based on the final season standing generate an NFT for each driver with the final result. 

The season ends on the 12th of December. I would like to launch the smart contract sooner on the mainnet and promote it to F1 fans. This app will of course be marked as unofficial. 

Graphics will be generated right after the last grand prix. NFTs should be mint ready after a couple of hours. 

### What needs to be specified?
I still need to figure out if I can make an generative graphic. I'm not sure about the implementation details here. Also maybe I update the metadata on the smart contract?

## Future development
For the next F1 season I would like to generate a NFT per each race. The NFTs should be generative and based on the API data directly on the smart contract.
